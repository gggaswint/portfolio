    "bio": "Before my industry career, I conducted neutrino-based astronomy research at UCI, working both remotely and on-site at detectors in Antarctica. My research involved simulations and data analysis of neutrino interactions, requiring advanced computational modeling. I have a strong foundation in software engineering, gained through academic research, personal projects, and industry roles, including my time as a systems engineer at Raytheon. This diverse experience allows me to approach technical challenges with a unique blend of scientific rigor, problem-solving, and software development expertise.",
